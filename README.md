# EDA & Data Visualization Practice in Python - Titanic Dataset

This project is a beginner-friendly exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the classic Titanic dataset, designed to practice Python, pandas, seaborn, and version control using Git and GitHub.

## Project Goals

- Practice essential data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
- Analyze key variables related to passenger survival in the Titanic dataset.
- Gain hands-on experience with version control using Git and GitHub in a professional development environment.
- Lay the groundwork for a future project involving predictive modeling (e.g., logistic or linear regression).

## Dataset

- Titanic Dataset - Kaggle
- Includes passenger demographics, ticket info, fare, and survival status

## Tools Used

- Python 3.12
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Key Insights

- Gender and age played a critical role in survival: women and children had significantly higher survival rates, reflecting the "women and children first" evacuation policy.
- Passenger class and fare were strong indicators of survival â€” passengers in first class and those who paid higher fares were more likely to survive, revealing a clear socioeconomic divide.
- These patterns suggest non-random survival behavior, making the dataset well-suited for future predictive modeling based on selected features.
